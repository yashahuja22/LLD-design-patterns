When to use the Prototype Design Pattern

--Below is when to use prototype design pattern:

    Use the Prototype pattern when creating new objects is more complex or costly than  copying existing ones. Cloning can be more efficient if significant resources are needed.
    
    The Prototype pattern is helpful for managing various objects with minor differences. Instead of creating multiple classes, you can clone and modify prototypes.
    
    Consider the Prototype pattern for dynamic configurations where you need to create objects at runtime. You can clone a base configuration and adjust it as necessary.
    
    The Prototype pattern can lower initialization costs, as cloning is often faster than building a new object from scratch, especially if initialization is resource-intensive.


When not to use the Prototype Design Pattern 

--Below is when not to use Prototype design pattern:

    Avoid using the Prototype pattern when your application predominantly deals with unique object instances, and the overhead of implementing the pattern outweighs its benefits.

    If object creation is simple and does not involve significant resource consumption, and there are no variations of objects, using the Prototype pattern might be unnecessary complexity.

    If your objects are immutable (unchangeable) and do not need variations, the benefits of cloning may not be significant.
    
    If your system has a clear and straightforward object creation process that is easy to understand and manage, introducing the Prototype pattern may add unnecessary complexity.
