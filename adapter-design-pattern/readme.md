âœ… What is the Adapter Pattern?

The Adapter Pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a bridge (adapter) between them.

Real-world analogy: Think of a travel plug adapter â€” if youâ€™re traveling from India (Type D plug) to the US (Type A/B), the adapter lets you plug your device into a socket with a different shape.

ðŸ§  Why is Adapter Pattern Useful?

You might have:
	â€¢	An existing class (legacy or 3rd-party) that doesnâ€™t match the interface your system expects.
	â€¢	You donâ€™t want to change the existing class.
	â€¢	So, you wrap it using an adapter.

âœ… Use Cases of Adapter Pattern
	â€¢	Integrating legacy systems into modern codebases
	â€¢	Wrapping 3rd-party libraries to match your interfaces
	â€¢	Making components interoperable without rewriting them
