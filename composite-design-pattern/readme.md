ðŸ§  What is the Composite Pattern?

The Composite Design Pattern is used when you want to treat individual objects and groups of objects (composites) in the same way.

ðŸ’¡ Real-World Analogy: File System

Think of a file system:
	â€¢	A File is a single item (like notes.txt)
	â€¢	A Folder can contain Files or other Folders

But both can:
	â€¢	show their name
	â€¢	calculate their size
	â€¢	be added to another folder

So, both File and Folder should implement the same interface.

Role                  Class
Component    ->       FileSystemItem
Leaf         ->       File
Composite    ->       Folder


The client treats both Files and Folders the same way via the FileSystemItem interface.
